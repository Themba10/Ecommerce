            <p class="text-muted" id="quality__text">Our poultry always produce healthy products ,it is important to be familiar with the characteristics of a healthy bird. 
                A healthy bird displays traits such as Erect stance with head and tail elevated, bright red comb and wattles 
                (except for those breeds with blue combs, such as the silkie), filled-out face parts, bright and alert eyes, clean nostrils,
                smooth, neat, clean feathers, filled-out legs, joints that are smooth and cool to the touch, weight that is typical for the 
                type and age of the bird, powerful movements when struggling, scales on the legs and feet that are clean and waxy in appearance, 
                color of the skin that is characteristics of the breed and strain of bird, as well as the age and state of production,
                in addition, a healthy bird eats and drinks frequently and displays no signs of respiratory distress.

                                When developing HACCP quality control checks, the next step involves establishing critical limits for all 
                                control points. The critical limits are arguments that help determine whether a control measure of the CCP 
                                is out of control.

                                Corrective action should be determined for each CCP in cases where the CL hasnâ€™t been met. 
                                Corrective actions used often depend on the type of process and type of food produced. 
                                In case there is any deviation from the CL, corrective action is required to prevent any hazardous 
                                food materials from being distributed to consumers.

                                HACCP systems of meat and poultry businesses should be systematically verified. There are 
                                four main verification principles used to verify HACCP systems as stated by the NACMCF. 
                                The verification process ensures that HACCP plans are implemented as planned. 
                                This process also confirms that the critical control points are accurate.

                <p class="text-muted">
                    Biosecurity has multiple meanings and is defined differently according to various disciplines. The original 
                    definition of biosecurity started out as a set of preventive measures designed to reduce the 
                    risk of transmission of infectious diseases in crops and livestock, quarantined pests, invasive alien 
                    species, and living modified organisms (Koblentz, 2010). Biosecurity and farm management will help decrease 
                    the chance of disease on the farm. The first step to disease prevention is protection from exposure to disease 
                    agents. Strictly following the biosecurity guidelines below will assist to decrease the chance of disease. 
                    Poultry diseases are controlled by biosecurity, veterinary health care, complete vaccination programs, high-quality 
                    diet, enclosed housing, and high standard of farm and bird management. Disease can occur if a flock is challenged 
                    with a new strain of a virus, bacteria, and parasite or if there is a breach in biosecurity. Biosecurity must 
                    be practiced at all times. All growers and workers should have documented biosecurity training. 
                    A biosecurity checklist should be posted or kept on each farm. Biosecurity measures should be audited 
                    frequently for compliance. The main concepts of commercial poultry production biosecurity are:
